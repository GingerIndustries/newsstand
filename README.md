# NewsStand: News for humans by humans
NewsStand is a PyGObject/Gtk based news application, capable of downloading news from almost any source, saving to articles, flagrantly locking up when you try to read PCMag, and more!

NOTE: Bugs with the content it downloads (article lists, article text/images, etc.) should go [here](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper), as this is the parsing engine NewsStand uses.
